# Corrupt Video 
Corrupt Video™ is an OpenFrameworks based Glitch Art Software allowing its users to glitch and record movies or to corrupt real time videos.

Corrupt™ is a web based Glitch Art Software allowing its user to upload and share corrupted images on corrupt.recyclism.com available since 2005. Corrupt™ was first built with Proce55ing (2004).

This ~~2011~~ 2018 version built with OpenFrameworks is a collaboration project between Recyclism and Martial Geoffre-Rouland.

Corrupt and Corrupt Video are using the same algorithm, which consists of a binary alteration of the original data. So technically Corrupt damages the data on a binary level, which result in unpredictable and beautiful results.
